## Generative AI Document Intelligence System

A complete end-to-end AI-powered system that extracts structured insights (like **Named Entities**, **Summaries**, **Key-Value pairs**) from **unstructured documents** such as PDFs and scanned images.

It combines the power of **OCR**, **NLP**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to turn raw documents into actionable knowledge.

---

## Features

- Upload PDF or image documents
- Detect and extract both **digital** and **image-based** text
- Generate smart **summaries** using BART LLM
- Extract **Named Entities** (ORG, PERSON, LOCATION, etc.) using BERT NER
- Output text and summary files available for download
- Clean, easy-to-use **Flask web interface**

## Module Breakdown (Why & What)

### `app.py` – Flask Web Application

* Acts as the **controller** to connect all modules.
* Routes:

  * `/`: Home page
  * `/upload`: Upload and process files
* Coordinates uploading, processing, and displaying results.

---

### `ocr_engine.py` – Image Text Extraction

* Uses **Tesseract OCR + OpenCV**.
* Preprocessing improves accuracy for noisy or scanned images:

  * Grayscale conversion
  * Denoising
  * Adaptive Thresholding
  * Morphological operations
  * Upscaling low-res images
* Why? Many PDFs or uploads are images (not digital text).

---

### `pdf_text_handler.py` – PDF Text Extraction (Hybrid)

* Uses **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** to:

  * Extract **digital text** from PDFs
  * Convert **image-based pages** to PNGs for OCR
* Smart fallback: if digital text is short, use OCR instead.
* Why? Some PDFs contain only scanned images; others contain real selectable text.

---

### `image_preprocessor.py`

* Used for enhancing scanned documents before OCR.
* Applies:

  * Sharpening filters
  * Resize/denoise
* Helps clean up blurred or noisy documents for better results.

---

### `summarizer.py` – Generate Summary

* Uses HuggingFace’s `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model.
* Accepts large raw text input and returns a summary.
* Why? To provide a **quick digest** of long documents.

---

### `ner_extractor.py` – Named Entity Recognition

* Uses `dslim/bert-base-NER` model.
* Identifies:

  * Names (PERSON)
  * Organizations (ORG)
  * Locations (LOC), etc.
* Results include: `word`, `entity`, `confidence score`.
* Why? For semantic understanding and search.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brajesh31/Generative-AI-Document-Intelligence-System.git
cd Generative-AI-Document-Intelligence-System
```

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. (Windows Only) Tesseract path

```python
# In ocr_engine.py
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

---

## Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

* Access at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## Sample Use Case

Upload a scanned letter →
System extracts text →
LLM summarizes it →
NER shows people/organizations →
Download output files.
